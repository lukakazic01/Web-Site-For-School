# Web-Site-For-School
Final version of my static web site made completely with bootstrap and fully responsive.
<br />
This was the web site i needed to create so i can pass the subject on my university.
<br />
I passed it with 10 grade, it met all the requirements i that professor proposed.

If you want to see the website, just clone the repository and open it in any IDE, like VS Code or Webstorm,
click on any html page inside IDE and it will open it in browser.

Enjoy :)
